# Smart-Auto-Dark-mode

This is a Firefox extension.

Automatically switches websites to dark mode based on your local time, with smart handling for sites that ignore dark mode.

Smart Auto Dark Mode makes browsing easier on the eyes by automatically enabling dark mode on websites according to your schedule.

Works with bare HTML sites, SPAs, and sites that don’t respect standard dark mode settings.

Detects if a site already supports dark mode and avoids overriding it unnecessarily.

Fully automatic, runs in the background and dynamically applies dark mode to new content.

Lightweight and privacy-friendly, does not collect any user data.
Customizable schedule: set your preferred dark mode start and end hours via the popup. Ideal for night-time browsing, low-light environments, or anyone who prefers a dark interface.

How it works:

Checks your defined time schedule.
Applies global dark mode where possible.
Injects a smart dark CSS only on sites that ignore dark mode.
Keeps dynamic content dark automatically.
No data collection, no tracking, just a smarter dark mode for every website you visit.
